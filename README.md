Project Structure
This repository is divided into two main sections:

# Backend (/backend):
Django-based project for handling all business logic, database models, API endpoints, and integrations.
Integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, and Slack to fetch data and provide insights.

# Frontend (/frontend):
A Next.js (React) project responsible for the user interface and interacting with the backend.
Provides a dashboard, meeting insights, real-time translation, and video recording features.

# Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
1. Python (for the backend)
2. Node.js (for the frontend)
3. MySQL (for the database)
4. API Keys:
   1. OpenAI
   2. Zoom
   3. Slack
   4. Google Meet
   5. Translation API (if needed)


## Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/parvinder204/smart-meeting-insights-assistant.git
cd smart-meeting-insights-assistant

## Step 2: Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend
Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (on Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)


Install the required Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure your .env file:

Run migrations to set up the database:
python manage.py migrate


# Step 3: Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder:
cd ../frontend

Install the required Node.js dependencies:
npm install

Configure your .env.local file (create it if it doesn't exist):

# Step 4: Running the Project
Run both the Django and Next.js servers using the run.py script in the root directory:
python run.py

# Step 5: Access the Application
The frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000
The backend API will be available at: http://localhost:8000/api
You can now access the app in your browser and start using its features.
